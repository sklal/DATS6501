Affordable healthcare is an essential component in people’s lives and a country’s government healthcare
policies and reforms is the backbone of any healthcare system. The accessibility to skilled and proficient
healthcare providers is very important for providing healthcare services but so is the affordability of the
care. One of the reasons why affordable that the US healthcare financial infrastructure is supported by
both private health insurance and public health coverage (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid). With the increase
in patients, the financial backbone is subject to more fraudulent actions leading to waste of resources and
loss of monetary benefits for people in need. According to CMS data, national health expenditure grew
4.6% to $3.8 trillion dollars in 2019 which is 17.7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Medicare spending
grew 6.7% to $799.4 billion in 2019, or 21% of total National Healthcare Expenditure. Prescription
drug spending increased 5.7% to $369.7 billion in 2019, faster than the 3.8% growth in 2018. According
to CMS (paste link here) National health expenditure fact-sheet, Medicare is expected to experience the
fastest spending growth (7.6% per year over 2019-28), largely as a result of having the highest projected
enrollment growth. Given the increase in the number of elderly groups, increases the healthcare and
financial requirements. During this time, Medicare assistance is of paramount importance for providing
affordable healthcare services to the elderly and Medicare Part d frauds is proven to be a major hindrance
to achieve that. The healthcare billing fraud is predicted to be from 3 percent to 10 percent of the
public healthcare expenditure and is continuously taking away from the Medicare program and its care
receivers. The counter programs, like the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, ordained to support fighting the
fraud, but varied efforts are required to improve the management of the consequences of fraud.
The aim of this project is to build a data analytical model, which can identify possible fraudulent claims
and their prescribers. The model should also be able to predict fraudulent claims/prescribers in the new
data with high accuracy level. For this project, both clustering and classification models were developed,
tuned and tested on the aggregated data from different national healthcare data sources. On the basis of
model evaluation results, optimal machine learning model is suggested to identify fraud prescription on
the new Medicare Part D data.
The outcomes of this project can be used to identify prescribers who not only are an hindrance for the
government’s aim to provide necessary financial aid to the public, especially the vulnerable group of
elderly but also pose a threat to increasing prescription drug abuse and opioid addiction. The outcomes
of this project will also help to identify the common features e.g. speciality group, average prescription
cost etc of the fraudulent cluster which can be used by the government to make necessary changes in the
prescription drug regulation and Medicare part D guidelines.
